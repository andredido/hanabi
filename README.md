Hanabi is an imperfect information game and also a multi-agent learning problem, so AI on this game is very difficult to implement.

For this reason I have implemented my agent as a rule based system.


## My Agent
Implemented in file **my_agent.py**.

Rule Based agent.
Instruction:
Start the server and then run in a shell:
```bash
python3 my_agent.py <id>
```
where \<id> is equal to a number, for different agent in the same game you need different number

## My Agent - Pro
Implemented in file **my_agent_pro.py**.

Rule based agent.
Instruction:
Start the server and then run in a shell:
```bash
python3 my_agent_pro.py <id>
```
where \<id> is equal to a number, for different agent in the same game you need different number
